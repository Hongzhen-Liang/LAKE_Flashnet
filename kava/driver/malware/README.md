# GhostBuster: Hardware-Accelerated In-Kernel Malware Detection

(Get it? Because we're trying to detect _Spectre_? Please hold your applause.)

## TODO
- [ ] Implementation.
- [ ] More bad puns.
- [ ] Run KNN from within the `ghost_buster` driver.
  - [ ] Get it running in the first place.
    - [ ] Finish port.
    - [ ] Deal with `float`s in the kernel, or discretize to make everything an
    `int`.
  - [ ] Run on bogus data.
  - [ ] Run on real data.
- [ ] Hook kernel tracing/`perf_event` API to measure a target process.
- [ ] Get SpectreV1 & SpectreV2 implementations running.
- [ ] Measure SpectreV1/V2 implementations & compare to other non-malicious
processes.
- [x] Integrate `kava_cuda` into `ghost_buster` driver.
- [x] Build out driver interface.
  - [x] Create a chardev to write to/read from.
- [x] Settle on an efficient KNN implementation.
  * [This one](https://github.com/vincentfpgarcia/kNN-CUDA) seems alright.
  Decent code quality, works out of the box, and seems to get good speedup. Also
  doesn't use any crazy parts of the CUDA API (I think we support all the
  necessary calls already). Claims to be from a Ph.D. thesis, so it *HAS* to be
  good... right?
